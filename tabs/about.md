Who the <b>#hack</b> is Zebra?!  
I‘m zebra, a Technically interested person (from Germany), who wants to learn new stuff. A few month ago I decided to learn more about IT security and find a lot of stuff on YouTube, Udemy and some books about this. My intention is to understand how Computer and the different protocols work to get a better understand of exploits (Safety deficiencies).
So I tried to get root on different virtual Maschine on tryhackme and hackthebox and document my approached on this blog.
